# Bike-Sales-Dashboard
On my journey in visualization of data, i am experimenting with MS Excel. I have used various datatsets that were previously used in my machine learning projects.
The idea is to build a simple and easy to understand dashboard.The data has been cleaned and pivot tables have been used to analyze the numerics.
The formulas invloved nested if function and usage of replace feature. Following questions have been answered via visualization:
Q1> bike purchases over various regions among different age group of people
Q2> Average income per region based on gender
Q3> Distance travelled by people of different age groups
To make the dashboard more interactive,Slicers have been used as well.
# Next step is to work on large datasets which involve cleaning and function usage at a larger scale
